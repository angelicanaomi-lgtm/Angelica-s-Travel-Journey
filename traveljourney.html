        <h3>Tokyo</h3>
        <p>
          Tokyo is the second favorite place after kyoto, the view is beautiful and I really like the food. However, it's not really my favorite one because it's too crowded.

        <h3>Kyoto</h3>
        <p>
          For me, Kyoto is the best one. The street food there is pretty good, and the locals are friendly too!

        <h3>Osaka</h3>
        <p>
          Osaka is my least favorite place. For me, the locals are friendly, and i like the food too. However, the hotel experience is not my favorite.

      <h2>Bali (Indonesia)</h2>
      <div class="place">
        <h3>Ubud</h3>
        <p>
          I love this place. The view is so pretty at the point I thought I was inside the fantasy world. The locals are friendly and kind too. In My Opinion, this is the best place in Bali

        <h3>Genting Highlands</h3>
        <p>
          For me, Genting Highland is really cold. Especially when it's raining. I've used 2 layers of jacket and still feel cold.

        <h3>Penang</h3>
        <p>
          I've visited this for three times and I love this place! Especially the street food. However, no offense but I think the locals there aren't as friendly as the other country i've visited.

      <div class="place">
        <h3>Kuala Lumpur</h3>
        <p>
         This place is my least favorite. The food is pretty good, the locals are much more friendly than Penang, but I don't like the hotel experience.
